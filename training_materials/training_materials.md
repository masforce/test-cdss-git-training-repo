Markdown is a easy way to create *HTML* documents that are simple to read.  For more information on syntax, see the Markdown [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Use the Atom text editor from the command line with the keyword 'atom' followed by the filename
- In Atom, access a live preview of the Markdown code with the command (Ctrl + shift + m)
- Two spaces at the end of a line generates a new line in Markdown
- Create a list by using a '-' followed by a space
- An asterisk on either side of text will make it italic
- Create headings with '#' followed by a space

# Git and GitHub  <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="drawing" width="50"/>
Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code, and maintains a record of differing versions of that project.

- When addressing an issue listed on GitHub, always create a branch to modify the project
- Branches are named in the following format:  (Issue number)-(Issue type)-(priority)-(brief detail)
- When merging a branch into the master, always use no fast forward: **git merge --no-ff**
