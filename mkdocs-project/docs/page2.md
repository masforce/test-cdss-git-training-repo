##Introduction continued

This is filler content intended to demonstrate the flexibility of the mkdocs format.  Content does not have to be restricted to a list format- like the cdss documentation and training pages, it can be organized in paragraphs and under the relevant headings.

##Tables

Let's make a table with markdown.  This is very simple:

```
  First header | Second header | Third header
  ------------ | ------------- | ------------
  Content cell | Content cell  | Content cell
  Content cell | Content cell  | Content cell
```
This format results in the following table:

  First header | Second header | Third header
  ------------ | ------------- | ------------
  Content cell | Content cell  | Content cell
  Content cell | Content cell  | Content cell

Make sure to indent the table.  It doesn't need to be lined up in markdown- the following will still render nicely on the finished page:

```
  | Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
  | -- | -- | -- |
  | 9:30 - 1:30 | 9:00 - 1:00 | 1:30 - 5:30 |
```
  Monday | Wednesday | Friday
  -- | -- | --
  9:30 - 1:30 | 9:00 - 1:00 | 1:30 - 5:30
